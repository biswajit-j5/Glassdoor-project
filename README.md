# Glassdoor-project
This project focuses on Glassdoor Jobs Salary Prediction using a cleaned dataset of job postings from Glassdoor. The primary goal is to analyze job attributes and predict the average salary offered for various positions, helping job seekers, HR teams, and businesses make informed decisions. We performed detailed data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applied machine learning models (such as linear regression) to build a salary prediction model.



Through this project, we:
Cleaned and transformed data to handle missing values and encode categorical features
Conducted EDA using visualizations like bar charts, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps
Trained models to predict salary based on key features
Derived insights to understand which factors influence salary most

This work demonstrates the use of Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for end-to-end machine learning workflow. The insights gained can help businesses align compensation strategies with market standards, and assist job seekers in salary negotiation.
